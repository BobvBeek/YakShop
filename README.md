## Overview

- `YakShop/` – .NET backend API
- `yak-shop-client/` – React frontend
- `YakShop.tests/` – Unit/integratietests

Start the API in Visual Studio using HTTPS. Adjust the connectionstring in the API and adjust the port the API can be reached on in the frontend. Run a migration using EF and use POST/herd to upload a herd (a nice herd can be found in the herd.json).
